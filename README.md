# Sweetest Tees T-Shirt Designer

<br>
Initial proposal:  
Our proposal is a tee shirt designer that allows the user to create a username and password for our web app. Once logged in the user would be able to see all previous tee shirts that they have created and update them if needed. When making a tee shirt we as developers want to collect information on the user such as shirt size, color of the shirt, and any additional logos or images they want to add to their design.<br><br>

MVP:  
Login/ User - Passport  
Tshirt Editor with colors and logos  
Save tshirts made to user account  
Deploy to Heroku<br><br>

User Story  
◦AS young developers who love video games.  
◦WE want to make an app to create customizable T Shirts that include some of our favorite video game logos and icons.  
◦SO that we can address and enhance our style as video gamers.
